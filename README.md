# LED Tetris
Programmed with C/C++ for Arduino Mega 2560.

## What you need
* A microcontroller (I personally used a Mega 2560.)
* An analog joystick
* 8x8 LED grid (MAX7219)
* A few M-M & M-F wires & breadboard

Schematics coming soon...

## Functionality
As of right now (December 26th, 2019), only the bare-bones structure is in place. 
The finite state machine (with the transitions, as well as some hardcoded conditions/inputs) is there.
Lots of bugs need to be fixed. But the joystick controls work somewhat, and you can shift the block left or right!

Planned development until school starts again (around late January 2020).
Will finish before then, hopefully.
